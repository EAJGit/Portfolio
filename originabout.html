            <p>Hi, my name is Edmund, I hope you like my portfolio website.  I would like to say that even though I am interested in gaining a programming job I have varied experience and interests.  I have experience working in an office.  I used to work as an office junior in a family business.  I was required to answer phone calls and organize documents.  I also have telesales experience, which could be intense because you could deal with hostile people and you still had make them interested in buying the product you wanted to sell.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have in the past had an online business which did involve programming and understanding SEO. SEO requires you to add code to your HTML to make your website have a stronger presence on search engines.  In SEO you also have to add links to your website and link to other websites to increase your presence on the internet.  In SEO it is also good to add your website to as many search engines as possible.  I also have bug testing experience.</p>
